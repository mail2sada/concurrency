## 🔹 Core Concurrency Patterns  

### Pipeline – Streamlined Data Processing  
📌 **Break tasks into multiple stages**, where each stage processes and passes data downstream.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Data streaming, ETL, analytics pipelines.  

### Worker Pool – Controlled Parallelism  
📌 **Restrict the number of concurrent goroutines** to avoid system overload.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Web crawlers, database queries.  

### Fan-Out, Fan-In – Parallel Execution with Aggregation  
📌 **Fan-Out:** Distribute work across multiple goroutines.  
📌 **Fan-In:** Merge results into a single output.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Concurrent API calls, parallel computations.  

### Pub-Sub – Message Broadcasting  
📌 **Publisher sends messages** to multiple independent subscribers asynchronously.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Event-driven systems, distributed messaging.  

### Or-Done – Graceful Cancellation  
📌 **Exit goroutines cleanly** when a cancellation signal is received.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Network requests, background jobs.

## 🧠 Advanced Concurrency Patterns  

### Work Stealing – Dynamic Load Balancing  
📌 **Idle goroutines steal tasks** from overloaded ones to optimize CPU usage.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Thread-pool optimization, distributed computing.  

### Backpressure Handling – Preventing Overload  
📌 **Control task processing rate** dynamically to prevent system bottlenecks.  
🔹 **Use Case:** API throttling, high-load request handling.  

### Leader-Follower – Efficient Task Coordination  
📌 **Leader goroutine assigns tasks**, followers wait to take over.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Cluster management, failover handling.  

### Circuit Breaker – Preventing System Overload  
📌 **Stops calling failing services** after detecting failures.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Resilient microservices, API gateways.  

### Event Loop + Goroutine Pool – Reactive Event Processing  
📌 **Manages events asynchronously** with efficient goroutine usage.  
🔹 **Use Case:** UI frameworks, game engines.

## 🚀 Intelligent Adaptive Patterns  

### Auto-Tuning Worker Pool – Adaptive Performance  
📌 **Dynamically adjusts worker count** based on system load.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Cloud-native applications, autoscaling.  

### Load-Shedding Worker Pool – Smart Rate Limiting  
📌 **Drops low-priority tasks** when system is overloaded.  
🔹 **Use Case:** High-traffic web servers, API throttling.  

### Pipeline with Intelligent Batching  
📌 **Dynamically aggregate requests** to optimize batch processing.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Database writes, bulk API calls.  

### Priority-Based Goroutine Scheduler  
📌 **Executes high-priority tasks** before lower-priority ones.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Real-time processing, QoS enforcement.  

### Timeout-Based Execution – Avoiding Stuck Goroutines  
📌 **Cancels long-running tasks** to free up resources.  
🔹 **Use Case:** API timeouts, transaction rollbacks.

## 🔬 Rate Limiting & Throttling  

### Leaky Bucket Algorithm – Steady Rate Throttling  
📌 **Ensures a consistent request processing rate**.  
🔹 **Use Case:** API rate limiting, traffic shaping.  

### Token Bucket Algorithm – Controlled Concurrency  
📌 **Allows controlled bursts** while enforcing an average rate limit.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Network traffic control, API quotas.  

### Dynamic Batching – Adaptive Request Aggregation  
📌 **Groups requests dynamically** based on system load.  
🔹 **Use Case:** High-frequency API requests, database transactions.

## 🎭 Isolation & Synchronization  

### Goroutine Affinity Model – Optimizing CPU Usage  
📌 **Pins goroutines to specific CPUs** to improve cache efficiency.  
🔹 **Use Case:** High-performance computing, real-time processing.  

### Actor Model – Isolated State Management  
📌 **Each actor has a private state** and communicates via message passing.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Distributed applications, game development.  

### Transactional Memory Concurrency – Lock-Free State Modifications  
📌 **Modifies shared state using atomic operations** without locking.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Optimized in-memory data structures.  

### Priority Queue Processing – Executing Tasks by Urgency  
📌 **Processes urgent tasks first**, ensuring critical workloads aren’t delayed.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Critical job scheduling, QoS enforcement.  

### Load-Shedding Worker Pool – Dropping Low-Priority Tasks  
📌 **Similar to backpressure handling** but dynamically drops less important tasks.  
🔹 **Use Case:** Scalable event processing, service prioritization.  

### Auto-Tuning Worker Pool (Duplicate Fix)  
📌 **Dynamically adjusts worker count
