## ğŸ”¹ Core Concurrency Patterns  

### Pipeline â€“ Streamlined Data Processing  
ğŸ“Œ **Break tasks into multiple stages**, where each stage processes and passes data downstream.  
ğŸ”¹ **Use Case:** Data streaming, ETL, analytics pipelines.  

### Worker Pool â€“ Controlled Parallelism  
ğŸ“Œ **Restrict the number of concurrent goroutines** to avoid system overload.  
ğŸ”¹ **Use Case:** Web crawlers, database queries.  

### Fan-Out, Fan-In â€“ Parallel Execution with Aggregation  
ğŸ“Œ **Fan-Out:** Distribute work across multiple goroutines.  
ğŸ“Œ **Fan-In:** Merge results into a single output.  
ğŸ”¹ **Use Case:** Concurrent API calls, parallel computations.  

### Pub-Sub â€“ Message Broadcasting  
ğŸ“Œ **Publisher sends messages** to multiple independent subscribers asynchronously.  
ğŸ”¹ **Use Case:** Event-driven systems, distributed messaging.  

### Or-Done â€“ Graceful Cancellation  
ğŸ“Œ **Exit goroutines cleanly** when a cancellation signal is received.  
ğŸ”¹ **Use Case:** Network requests, background jobs.
